## CSS

A CSS implementation is available in the /css folder, including themes
for common frameworks like Shoelace and Web Awesome.

All CSS files are available in a CDN:

https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/hotosm-ui-design@1.1.0/dist/hot-sl.css
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/hotosm-ui-design@1.1.0/dist/hot-font-face.css

And you can also install the NPM package:

`npm i hotosm-ui-design`

And import the CSS files:

```
@import 'hotosm-ui-design/dist/hot.css';
@import 'hotosm-ui-design/dist/hot-sl.css';
@import 'hotosm-ui-design/dist/hot-font-face.css';
```

For using fonts, you'll need the `.ttf` files available in `public/assets/fonts`.
